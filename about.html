  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>
    I am Deep Das, a Computer Science Engineering undergraduate at The Assam Kaziranga University, with a strong foundation in programming, web development, and data analysis. Passionate about solving real-world problems through technology, I have worked on diverse projects such as a C Bug Detection tool using machine learning, a personal portfolio website, review analysis on Tinder datasets, and EcoGive â€“ a sustainable donation platform that promotes recycling and community sharing. Alongside my technical skills in Python, C++, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, MongoDB, and data visualization with Pandas and Matplotlib, I continuously enhance my problem-solving abilities through regular practice on platforms like GeeksforGeeks. I also maintain a personal GitHub repository to document my growth and experiments in programming.
</p>
<p>Beyond academics, I value team collaboration, critical thinking, and communication skills, which I have demonstrated while working on group projects and delivering impactful presentations. My curiosity for learning and adapting has driven me to earn certifications in certain domains, further expanding my technical expertise. Outside the technical sphere, I am equally passionate about singing, which reflects my creative side and balance between analytical and artistic pursuits. With a strong drive for continuous growth, I aim to contribute meaningfully to innovative projects, while building a career that combines technology, creativity, and social impact.
